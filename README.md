1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>


2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Simple_ddos_prevention_tool


3. Run the main script:

## Usage

The Simple DDoS Prevention Tool provides a straightforward way to defend against DDoS attacks. Simply run the main script and follow the on-screen instructions to configure the tool according to your network's requirements. The tool continuously monitors incoming traffic, detects potential DDoS activity, and applies appropriate countermeasures to mitigate the impact on your network services.

## Configuration

Customize the tool's behavior by adjusting the configuration parameters in the `config.py` file. You can enable or disable protection for TCP and UDP protocols, and set thresholds for maximum allowed connections or packets per second. Fine-tune these settings to suit your specific network environment and security needs.
